The purpose of this course is to provide a broad overview of many areas of complier design,
including: High-level programming language specifications; Lexical and syntactics structure,
regular expression, finite automata and lexical analyser; Context-free grammars and parsing; LR
parsers; Symbol tables; Storage allocation; Code optimization and generation.
